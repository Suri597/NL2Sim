scripts2/verification_layer2.py
---------------------------------
Layer2: referential integrity checks (cross-entity references).

Unlike verification_layer1.py (which only ever looks inside a single
entry), this layer checks references BETWEEN sections -- does a name
used in one place actually exist where it's supposed to be declared.

Conditions are added one at a time, by explicit instruction, and tested
before the next one is added. Do not add new checks here without
confirming the condition first.

Implemented so far:
    1. intermediate_materials[].bom keys must exist in raw_materials[].name
    2. products[].bom keys must exist in raw_materials[].name OR
       intermediate_materials[].name
    3. inventory[].name must exist in the material list corresponding to
       inventory[].type (raw_material -> raw_materials, etc.)
    4. supplier[].supply_material_name must exist in raw_materials[].name
    5. facility[].inventory_managed entries must exist in raw_materials[],
       intermediate_materials[], or products[] (any material category)
    6. (WARNING only) for manufacturing facilities: operation.input/output
       materials should appear in that facility's own inventory_managed,
       and vice versa -- every inventory_managed material should be
       referenced in operation.input or operation.output. Two-directional,
       local to a single facility entry (not cross-entity like 1-5).
    7. customer[].product must exist in products[].name
    8. every supplier[].name must be registered in nodes[0].supplier, and
       every facility[].name must be registered in nodes[0].facility
       (the reverse of checks 1-5: an entity that EXISTS but isn't
       referenced from nodes -- this is the original TechPartners bug
       from early in this project's debugging history)
    9. edges[].material_name must exist in the material list corresponding
       to edges[].material_type (raw_material -> raw_materials, etc.) --
       same pattern as check 3 (inventory), applied to edges.
    10. facility[].operation.resource_required, IF it is set to something
        other than blank/"missing" (it's a silent/optional field per
        verification_layer1.py), must match a real resource[].name entry.
    11. edges[].source and edges[].destination must be registered node
        names (nodes[0].supplier union nodes[0].facility).
    12. REVERSE of check 8: every name in nodes[0].supplier must exist as
        a real supplier[].name, and every name in nodes[0].facility must
        exist as a real facility[].name -- a name sitting in nodes with
        nothing behind it is a phantom node.
    13. no name may be claimed by more than one of raw_materials[],
        intermediate_materials[], products[] -- the original example that
        started this layer's design.
    14. for manufacturing facilities: operation.input/output entries must
        exist in SOME material list (raw/intermediate/product), checked
        directly -- not just internally consistent with inventory_managed
        (that's check 6, which is local and WARNING-only).
    15. no duplicate names WITHIN a single section (supplier,
        raw_materials, intermediate_materials, products, resource) --
        an ambiguous reference target. FACILITY and CUSTOMER are EXEMPT
        from this blanket rule -- see checks 21 and 22, which allow
        same-named entries specifically when disjoint on the relevant
        dimension (facility: operation.output; customer: product) --
        safe because every reference that matters carries that context
        alongside the name.
    16. no duplicate edges -- same (source, destination, material_name)
        triple appearing more than once.
    17. no name may be claimed by both supplier[].name and facility[].name
        -- would make edges/nodes references ambiguous about which entity
        is meant.
    18. every customer[].name must be registered in nodes[0].customer
        (mirrors check 8, now that nodes[0] carries a customer key).
        Checks 11 and 12 were also updated to include customer names as
        valid edge endpoints / phantom-node targets, respectively.
    19. for every edge whose destination is a FACILITY, the edge's
        material_name must appear in that facility's inventory_managed
        OR operation.input -- otherwise the edge delivers material the
        destination facility doesn't acknowledge managing or consuming
        at all (a "phantom delivery"). Edges into a customer are exempt.
    20. every raw_materials[]/intermediate_materials[]/products[] entry
        must have a corresponding inventory[] entry (matched by name) --
        the REVERSE of check 3, which only verifies an EXISTING inventory
        entry points at a real material.
    21. facility-specific counterpart to check 15: two facility[] entries
        MAY share a name, but only if their operation.output sets are
        fully disjoint. Flags the case where that condition fails --
        genuinely overlapping outputs (real ambiguity), or a same-named
        facility missing operation.output entirely (can't confirm
        disjointness, treated as unsafe).
    22. customer-specific counterpart to check 15/21: two customer[]
        entries MAY share a name, but only if they order different
        products. Flags the case where they order the same product, or
        either lacks a product (can't confirm safety).
